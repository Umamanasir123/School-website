            <h1>UNITED EDUCATORS OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>
                Established in Karachi in 1988, The United educators is today one of the largest private school networks
                across the globe.
                Having more than 2500 students we continue to expand our reach in different locations of Karachi to meet
                the demands for quality education as well as to ensure a strong global presence.
                The knowledge and skills-based curriculum derived from the national curriculum guides students from
                Nursery to Matriculation, qualifying them for the Board and O and A levels examinations.

            <h1>CURRICULUM & ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY</h1>
            <p>Pass out students from United Educators secure positions in top colleges and universities worldwide. Our
                students, according to Cambridge Assessment International Examinations annual results analysis, are
                amongst the highest achievers in their city, their country and, in some cases, in the world. The
                curriculum encourages a student-centered approach where learners have an active role in their learning  process and develop the skills and ability to make a significant contribution to society. Its particular strength lies in the integration of digital media and ICTs in an array of learning programmes. </p>

            <h1>GROUP CHAIRPERSON’S MESSAGE</h1>
            <p>Millennia ago, Socrates claimed that, “To say ‘I know’ is to close one’s mind to knowledge”. Channelling that spirit at The City School, our motto is ‘I Am To Learn’, because we too believe that learning is  limitless. We aim to develop each one of our students into true learners, individuals who always seek to  broaden their perspective and to face life’s challenges with courage and conviction.</p>
            <h1>PRINCIPLE'S MESSAGE</h1>
            <p>For us, education is a pursuit that goes far beyond a qualification. While we aim to help our students excel in the course they are studying, we also hope to instil in them a thirst for learning throughout their lives. At UE, our teachers, students, and parents work together to realise this goal.</p>
