        <div class="box" ><img class="imgg" src="abimges/m22.jpeg" alt="Science"><p id="ys">“United Educators fosters amazing kindness in it’s students. I have been to all of my sons basketball games and I am truly amazed by the sportsmanship and care that the students show when another team’s players gets hurt. In this day and age where kindness and humbleness seems to not exist, it is so nice to know that my child is part of such an amazing community. </p>

The school has exceeded our expectations in developing the whole child.Cambridge School’s staff and teachers should feel so proud. The school truly embraces the entire child; academically, socially and spiritually. My son has been so lucky to have such a supportive environment". </p></p></div>
        <div class="box"><img class="imgg" src="abimges/m3.jpeg" alt="Science"><p id="ys">The Cambridge School has been a godsend for our youngest daughter. We found the school after two terrifying years in public schools. Our daughter is dyslexic and by the third grade, she still wasn’t reading at all. We enrolled her in the Cambridge School upon a recommendation from a summer school teacher. We haven’t regretted our decision for one moment. The teachers at Cambridge are amazing.</p></div>
